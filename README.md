### __PROJECT DESCRIPTION__
#### __Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)__ ####

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows: 

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

#### __Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)__ ####
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

__For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.__

#### __Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)__ ####
Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that would calculate the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

__NB:__ Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
